DuckForms isnâ€™t just another form library. It's a versatile form builder that works with React and integrates seamlessly with your choice of form management libraries like [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/), [Formik](https://formik.org/), and others. By using schema-driven configurations and custom components, DuckForms simplifies building complex, production-ready forms, reducing boilerplate and enhancing both developer experience (DX) and user experience (UX).
